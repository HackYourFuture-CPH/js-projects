# RECIPE APP

You are a foood lover, a cooking enthusiast and you want to share your passion with the web. You aspire to build a cool recipe website as a hobby project and eventually earn a little bit on the side from it.

## Weekly specs:

### `JS2 week1` - Browser environment, DOM manipulation, DOM event listeners

You are provided with a recipe data object.

- [ ] Display a single recipe on the page using DOM manipulation.
- [ ] Implement a form to add a new recipe with a minimum of 5 ingredients.
- [ ] Optional: implement functionality to add a new ingredient to a recipe.

---

### `JS2 week2` - Array functions, Arrow function

You are provided with an array of recipe objects, that have at least an ID, a title, a picture url and a list of ingredients.

- [ ] Traverse through the array of recipe objects and display all the recipe cards in a grid.
- [ ] Implement functions to manipulate the array:
- find a recipe by a provided search word to check in the recipe title.
- sort the recipe array by the amount of ingredients needed.

---

### `JS2 week3` - Callback function, Asynchronicity, Scope

- [ ] Implement a cooking timer where the time is user-picked via an input or hard-coded. The timer should alert and/or ring once the time is up.
- [ ] Implement a timer for how much time you have spent on the page.

---

### `JS3 week1` - Json, Apis, Fetch

- [ ] Refactor your code so that you ditch the static array of objects and instead fetch the recipes data from an API.

- [ ] Ensure all the functionality is working smoothly after refactoring.

---

### `JS3 week2` - Promises, Async/Await

- [ ] Use the fuunctions created in preivous week and build functionality to:
- find a recipe by a provided search word to check in the recipe title.
- sort the recipe array by the amount of ingredients needed.

---

### `JS3 week3` - Classes, Promises advanced
