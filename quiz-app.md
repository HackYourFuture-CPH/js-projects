# QUIZ APP

// TODO: add storyline

## Weekly specs:

### `JS2 week1` - Browser environment, DOM manipulation, DOM event listeners

- create a form to insert a quiz question. It should take a question and 4 options for answers. There should be a way to mark which one is the correct answer in the form, but you should only be able to select one correct answer.

- implement one of the two (or both!)

a. add a button that randomizes the order of the 4 option inputs once they have been filled in.

b. color the input for the "correct" answer option in green and the "wrong" ones in red. Make sure it's still readable.

- optional bonus: make sure the question is not longer than 140 characters.

---

### `JS2 week2` - Array functions, Arrow function

- save the quiz question into an array when the form is submitted.

- show a list of all quiz questions added to the array below the form. It should show the questions, the 4 options but not which one is correct. Add a button to reveal which is the correct answer for each question.

- optional bonus: Add a search input to filter the questions by searching the content of the question.

---

### `JS2 week3` - Callback function, Asynchronicity, Scope

- add inputs for 2 player names and a button to start a quiz. When the quiz starts, player names are displayed with their collected points (0 to begin with).
- implement one of the two:

a. next to each player's name, add two buttons [Correct] and [Wrong]. When the correct button for a player is pressed, they score 1 point, when the wrong button is pressed, the other player scores one point.

b. add number inputs for the player points and use the browser's arrow buttons on the input fields to increase/decrease the points.

- optional bonus: Play a sound and end the quiz game when one of the players has reached 10 points.

---

### `JS3 week1` - Json, Apis, Fetch

- refactor your code so that you ditch the static array of objects and instead fetch the questions data from an API
- implement functionality to search for a question
- optional bonus: add alphabetical sorting of the questions and random sorting of the questions and let the user choose.
- ensure all the functionality is working smoothly after refactoring.

---

### `JS3 week2` - Promises, Async/Await

- you used promise chaining last week - now rewrite the fetch in the "async await" approach.

// TODO: more?

---

### `JS3 week3` - Classes, Promises advanced

- rest, revise, finish and brush up your project, prepare to present and explain it
- optionally, make improvements or add additional functionality

// TODO: add an "am I done, is it working?" checklist
