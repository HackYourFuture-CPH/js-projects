# CURRENCY CONVERTER

You started working in a new cool fintech startup, and your first task is to build a simple currency converter app.
It is expected that your app will have at least these features and functionality:

- insert a new rate
- list currencies and rates
- search currencies
- set a rate to be alerted when a currency reaches that rate
- the ‘most moving’ currency rate
- timeout for market open/close
- call currency API
- deposits, crypto, crazy

// TODO: finish / edit the storyline and general reqs
<br/>
// TODO: finish the weekly specs

## Weekly specs:

### `JS2 week1` - Browser environment, DOM manipulation, DOM event listeners

- create a form to insert a new currency rate.

- implement one of the two (or both!)
<br/>
a.

b.

- optional bonus:

---

### `JS2 week2` - Array functions, Arrow function

- traverse through an array of the currency rate objects, and display them in a grid of items containing all the relevant details.
- implement a function to find a specific currency rate, searching by the abbreviation.

- optional bonus:

---

### `JS2 week3` - Callback function, Asynchronicity, Scope

- implement a timeout to open or close the market.
- implement one of the two (or both):
<br/>
a.

b.

- optional bonus:

---

### `JS3 week1` - Json, Apis, Fetch

- refactor your code so that you ditch the static array of objects and instead fetch the currency rates data from an API
- implement functionality to search for a specific currency
- optional bonus:
- ensure all the functionality is working smoothly after refactoring.

---

### `JS3 week2` - Promises, Async/Await

- you used promise chaining last week - now rewrite the fetch in the "async await" approach.

// TODO: more?

---

### `JS3 week3` - Classes, Promises advanced

- rest, revise, finish and brush up your project, prepare to present and explain it
- optionally, make improvements or add additional functionality

---

// TODO: add an "am I done, is it working?" checklist
