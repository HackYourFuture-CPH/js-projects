# RECIPE APP

// TODO: add storyline

## Weekly specs:

### `JS2 week1` - Browser environment, DOM manipulation, DOM event listeners

You are provided with a picture and a card backside pattern picture (or pick your own).

- display a single recipe on the page using DOM manipulation.
- implement a form to add a new recipe with a minimum of 5 ingredients.
- optional: implement functionality to add a new ingredient to a recipe.

---

### `JS2 week2` - Array functions, Arrow function

You are provided with an array of recipe objects, that have at least an ID, a title, a picture url and a list of ingredients.

- traverse through the array of recipe objects and display all the recipe cards in a grid.
- implement functions to manipulate th array:
- find a recipe by a provided search word to check in the recipe title.
- sort the recipe array by the amount of ingredients needed.
  // TODO: more?

---

### `JS2 week3` - Callback function, Asynchronicity, Scope

- implement a cooking timer where the time is user-picked via an input or hard-coded. The time should alert and/or ring once the time is up.
- implement a timer for how much time you have spent on the page.

---

### `JS3 week1` - Json, Apis, Fetch

- refactor your code so that you ditch the static array of objects and instead fetch the recipes data from an API
- implement functionality to search for an ingredient, fetch and display the relevant ingredient prices for a recipe

// TODO: decide and reformulate the above

- ensure all the functionality is working smoothly after refactoring.

---

### `JS3 week2` - Promises, Async/Await

- you used promise chaining last week - now rewrite the fetch in the "async await" approach.
  
// TODO: more?

---

### `JS3 week3` - Classes, Promises advanced

- rest, revise, finish, and brush up your project, prepare to present and explain it.
- optionally, make improvements or add additional functionality.
