# MOVIE APP

// TODO: add storyline

## Weekly specs:

### `JS2 week1` - Browser environment, DOM manipulation, DOM event listeners

You are provided with a movie object with details such as ID, title, description, year, main actors, etc.

- design and implement the layout of the movie card via DOM manipulation.

- via DOM manipulation, implement one of the two (or both!):
- submitting and displaying a comment about the movie.
- rating the movie in a star-rating format and displaying the submitted rating.

---

### `JS2 week2` - Array functions, Arrow function

You are provided with a mock list of movies (an array of objects).

- manipulate the movie array:
  <br/>
  // TODO: add more specific spec for sort filter search (essentially the current homework. Will be explained that it will be later used to search, filter, etc.)

- traverse the movie array and display all the movies on the page in a grid via DOM manipulation.

---

### `JS2 week3` - Callback function, Asynchronicity, Scope

- implement a timer where you can set a time for how much time you give yourself to pick a movie to watch, the timer alerts or rings when then time is over.
- implement a timer for how long you have spent on the page.

---

### `JS3 week1` - Json, Apis, Fetch

- refactor your code so that you ditch the static array of objects and instead fetch the movies data from an API
- ensure all the functionality is working smoothly after refactoring

---

### `JS3 week2` - Promises, Async/Await

- you used promise chaining last week - now rewrite the fetch in the "async await" approach
- fit and apply one (or all) of your functions from JS2 week2 to manipulate the displayed movies:

- a function to search a movie by title that a user submits via an input, displaying only the matching movies
- a function to sort the movies by a property selected via a dropdown
- a function to filter the movies by a specific constraint submitted by the user via an input, only displaying the relevant movies

---

### `JS3 week3` - Classes, Promises advanced

- rest, revise, finish, and brush up your project, prepare to present and explain it
- optionally, make improvements or add additional functionality, if you feel like it

---

// TODO: add an "am I done, is it working?" checklist
