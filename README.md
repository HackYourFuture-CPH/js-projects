# WHAT

Your weekly homework assignments during JS2 and JS3 will be replaced by weekly deliveries for **one continuous project**. <br/>At the end of JS3, you will have built an actual app, using your newly gained knowledge and coding skills!

# WHY

What does it mean exactly? Is it a good or a bad thing?

It is indeed a good thing, at least for these main reasons:

- You will work on one continuous idea, instead of switching contexts for every new homework every week;
- You will apply your learnings each week in a coherent way, understanding how each new method can be implemented in an actual product;
- You will build a solid project for your portfolio and will be able to showcase it in your future tech interviews!

<br/>

# HOW

Your weekly workflow and homework submission will stay essentially very much the same. If anything, the scope of each weekly delivery will most probably be notably smaller than any single homework has been so far.

<br/>
You will pick a project idea (see the "projects" folder) and will have specific tasks for each week to deliver. Those tasks are provided in your chosen project description. The tasks are designed to make you practise the main learning points throughout the 2 modules:

<br/>

`JS2 week1` - Browser environment, DOM manipulation, DOM event listeners

`JS2 week2` - Array functions, Arrow function

`JS2 week3` - Callback function, Asynchronicity, Scope

`JS3 week1` - Json, Apis, Fetch

`JS3 week2` - Promises, Async/Await

`JS3 week3` - Classes, Promises advanced

<br/>

You will work on your project repository for JS2 and JS3 (not the central homework repository) and you will submit the weekly task in the usual way by creating a Pull Request.

During JS2 and JS3, refer to the relevant [homework submission guide](/guides/weekly-submission-guide.md).

The main difference is that you will be on a different repository and that you will merge the PR after implementing the review-based improvements, while all the technical steps are the same as always.
