# WHAT

Your weekly homework assignments during JS2 and JS3 will be replaced by weekly deliveries for **one continuous project**. <br/>At the end of JS3, you will have built an actual app, using your newly gained knowledge and coding skills!

<br/>

# WHY

What does it mean exactly? Is it a good or a bad thing?

It is indeed a good thing, at least for these main reasons:

- You will work on one continuous idea, instead of switching contexts for every new homework every week;
- You will apply your learnings each week in a coherent way, understanding how each new method can be implemented in an actual product;
- You will build a solid project for your portfolio and will be able to showcase it in your future tech interviews!

<br/>

# HOW

Your weekly workflow and homework submission will stay essentially very much the same. If anything, the scope of each weekly delivery will most probably be notably smaller than any single homework has been so far.

<br/>
You will pick a project idea and will have specific tasks for each week to deliver. Those tasks are provided in your chosen project description. The tasks are designed to make you practise the main learning points throughout the 2 modules:

`JS2 week1` - Browser environment, DOM manipulation, DOM event listeners

`JS2 week2` - Array functions, Arrow function

`JS2 week3` - Callback function, Asynchronicity, Scope

`JS3 week1` - Json, Apis, Fetch

`JS3 week2` - Promises, Async/Await

`JS3 week3` - Classes, Promises advanced

<br/>

So, the flow, in broad strokes, will be like this:

- You work on your project repository (not the central homework repository);
- You submit the weekly task in the usual way - create a new branch (same branch naming convention as before), push your code, and create a pull request - all the same as it has been so far.

The main difference is that you are on a different repository and that you will merge the PR after implementing the review-based improvements, but all the technical steps are the same and you can refer to the same old guide!
